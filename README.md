The scripts / code that you find in this repository are projects that I am actively working on (though some of them I am not working on as diligently as I could probably be :) ).

# Active Projects:

## GTAO Solo Public Lobby Program: 
  Description - For those of us that want to play Grand Theft Auto Online but don't want to play with people or are tired of the griefers. This project when finished will itentify the specfiic GTA 5 process running on your computer regardless of it is legacy or the enhanced edition then suspend that process for 10 seconds from creating network traffic and the resuming the process creating for you a solo public game in which you can do all of your missions with out the fear of interruptions. The first stage of this is the script out the actual suspension of the process and get that working. This script alone will not make this program work as intended because when you create your solo public space that opens that space for other players to join it but it is a step in the right direction. The second part to this program will be code to monitor your game and isolate you every time that a player joins.

## Status:
1. GTAO Solo Lobby script - Completed and functional. Written in PowerShell as a proof of concept requires pssuspend64 or pssuspend from PSTools and the addition of directory where you unzipped PSTools added to the system PATH for it to function (please note that if you use pssuspend instead of the 64 bit edition you will need to modify the code)
2. GTAO Solo Lobby Program:
   - GTAO Solo Lobby core code - Not Started (probably python)
   - GTAO Solo Lobby monitor code - Not Started (probably python)

## File Maintenance Utility Program: 
Description - I am constantly doing some form of file maintenance, renaming files, locating typos in files, and the like. This program will consist of a GUI based program that will take in a directory to search from the user which can include subdirectories and perform the following actions on it. Rename files, find and replace, convert one file type to another (i.e. .webp files to .jpg files), and search for duplicate files using file hashes. I am sure that I will expand this program as I think of or run into new things that I would like to automate. 

## Status:
1. File Maintenance Utility Program:
   - GUI interface - Not Started
   - User directory input - Not Started
   - Rename file function - Not Started
   - Find and replace function - Not Started
   - File conversion function - Not Started (might have sub-options for different types of conversions)
